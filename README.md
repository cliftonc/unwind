## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `using-unwind` | Getting started with Unwind skills |

### Planned Skills

- `analyzing-codebase` - Systematic approach to understanding unfamiliar codebases
- `mapping-services` - Discovering service boundaries and dependencies
- `discovering-apis` - Finding and documenting API endpoints
- `tracing-data-flow` - Following data through systems
- `documenting-architecture` - Generating architecture documentation
- `identifying-patterns` - Recognizing design patterns in existing code

## Philosophy

- **Systematic over ad-hoc**: Use structured approaches rather than random exploration
- **Document as you go**: Capture discoveries immediately
- **Verify assumptions**: Test your understanding before documenting it as fact
- **Build incrementally**: Start with high-level understanding, drill down as needed
